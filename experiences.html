                <em>Supervisor: Dr. AmirNader Askarpour</em> <br />

                The purpose was to provide a mathematical model to analytically
                simulate plasma-based flow control actuators based on the
                electrodynamic considerations of the plasmonic medium. The
                objective is to develop the model based on fewer assumptions but
                more flexible to make the actuators tunable to specific modes to
                control the magnitude and the direction of the produced momentum
                vector.

                dielectric media with a calculated permittivity representing the
                plasmonic region under excitation.

                integrals and then transformed one into the Fourier type, and
                computed by the generalized Gauss–Laguerre quadrature and

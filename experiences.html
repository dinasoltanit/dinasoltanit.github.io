                <br />
                The purpose is to provide a mathematical model to analytically
                simulate plasma-based flow control actuators based on the
                electrodynamic considerations of the plasmonic medium. The
                objective is to develop the model based on fewer assumptions but
                more flexible for controlling purposes. My ultimate goal is to
                engineer the dielectric to make it tunable to specific modes to
                control the magnitude and the direction of the momentum vector
                produced by the plasma actuator.

**Is Boeing really losing the game to Airbus?**
***Work Culture, Boeing vs Airbus — What Are We Really Talking About?***

A colleague once asked my opinion on a project where they were supposed to design a plan to change a company’s work culture — and they picked Boeing, arguing that Boeing is losing the game to Airbus. I’m not critical per se; this is just a matter of honest curiosity. The prompt rested on the premise: Airbus has outpaced Boeing in aircraft deliveries in recent years. That made me pause and think — if the goal is to change “work culture,” is comparing delivery numbers really the right benchmark? Or are there deeper structural and cultural dimensions at play?

The anecdote they used was personal and heartfelt. A team member recalled flying on a Boeing jet as a young boy, being invited into the cockpit, and feeling inspired by the openness of the crew. It’s a lovely memory — but it doesn’t really speak to what helps a global manufacturer deliver reliably, safely, and at scale.

So I stepped back and asked: what are the real metrics behind “outpacing”? If Boeing is indeed falling behind, what are the underlying factors? How many branches does Airbus have? How does Boeing compare in terms of size, operational diversity, product mix? What are the foundational philosophies of each company? And how would one even begin comparing their internal work cultures?

If the metric is production rate — yes, Airbus has been delivering more aircraft recently. But then again, how fast is too fast? What happens to quality control, safety checks, testing, and oversight? Are Airbus’s checklists looser? Or are they simply more efficient? And is that always a good thing? What about major crashes? Technical issues? Emissions? Turnaround times between flights?

To build context, consider recent production figures. In 2024, Airbus delivered 766 commercial aircraft to 86 customers, while Boeing delivered 348. Airbus currently holds a backlog of over 8,600 aircraft. Though Boeing historically led in total output, Airbus has gradually overtaken it in recent years — its A320 family recently became the most-delivered jet series in history, surpassing the 737. Still, Boeing maintains a larger in-service fleet, with over 14,000 aircraft flying globally.

To put things in perspective on safety, both manufacturers operate under strict regulatory oversight and undergo extensive certification processes. Boeing’s 777X, for instance, requires around 2,400 hours of flight testing. Even the 737 MAX’s MCAS software update involved over 1,500 hours of test flights. Airbus follows similarly rigorous procedures, with hundreds of flight hours and thousands of test points reviewed by EASA and the FAA before approval.

Statistically, both companies show comparable safety records. Between 2013 and 2022, Boeing aircraft were involved in 60 commercial accidents, Airbus in 50. Once adjusted for fleet size and flight volume, both average fewer than six incidents per million departures. Independent analyses consistently find the difference statistically insignificant — with both manufacturers operating within modern aviation’s high safety margins.

If I were advising Boeing on a cultural-reflection plan — not as a critique, but as a thought exercise — I’d start by asking them to clarify their belief axioms: What do they value most? Engineering robustness? Long-term safety? Innovation? Workforce well-being? Then I’d examine how those values manifest across their branches — in recruitment, design reviews, maintenance procedures, supply-chain policies, quality assurance, and how the organization responds to failure.

Maybe Airbus does some of these things more effectively — perhaps with more agile supply-chain management, more efficient production systems, or tighter feedback loops. But it doesn’t follow that just because Airbus delivers more planes, its internal culture is “better.” That only tells us their current strategy is yielding higher output — not necessarily greater resilience or long-term quality.

If the goal is to propose a work-culture change in a company like Boeing, I believe the plan should rest on multidimensional metrics: safety records, maintenance cycles, reporting culture, employee retention, innovation rate, and supply-chain robustness — not just delivery numbers.

I find this topic fascinating, not because I want to criticize, but because it raises deep questions about what “success” really means in aerospace manufacturing. And if one is going to suggest a cultural shift, this kind of deeper reflection seems necessary.

When I was an undergraduate, we had a course called Introduction to Aerospace Engineering. Early on, we were assigned to study different parts of the Airbus A380 in teams of three. It was a good experience — we had to study a lot to prepare — but looking back now, I think this kind of question would be even better as a project. It invites groups to build their own arguments, guided by curiosity, and encourages independent thinking across technical, organizational, and ethical dimensions.

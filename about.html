              “The discovery of a complete unified theory may not aid the
              survival of our species, and may not even affect our life-style,
              but that humanity's deepest desire for knowledge is justification
              enough for our continuing quest, and that our goal is nothing less
              than a complete description of the Universe we live in.”</em

            I remember the first time I heard of M-theory. I was not a physics
            student. Instead, I double-majored in engineering with a focus on
            the Physics context. Dissatisfied with my learning experience during
            my second and third years of university, although enjoying the
            lectures, I used to feel limited in my thinking way. To satisfy my
            curiosity, I began reading physics books, the first of which was
            Stephen Hawking's A Brief History of Time. His words about the
            unified theory have stayed with me ever since. <br />
            <br />
            Coming from a community of people who think of engineering fields as
            the most promising field of study for a met future life with parents
            who did their best to support their children from every aspect, and
            teachers who contributed to help me with my questions, being
            accepted to Amirkabir University was a significant event. For my
            family and me, this was a way to ensure that I could leave behind
            their struggles. Having received a world-class education in a field
            which, in my opinion, has provided me with the understanding that
            human beings are able to think of both abstract and concrete
            subjects far away from the daily ones. <br />
            <br />
            When I was about to finish my second year at the university, I
            managed to pursue another degree in Electrical Engineering. Based on
            results from consultations with alumni and my instructors, I thought
            this combination of studies would provide me with a more thorough
            background in Physics. At the same time, I had experienced enjoying
            night walks, coming back from my late-night studies at the
            university’s library, and listening to The Grand Design, The First
            Three Minutes, and similar topics. Through these transformative
            experiences, I realized where I wanted to continue my studies was to
            provide a better complete description of the universe. However, the
            unanswered question for me was how I can help this quest. How can I
            use my education to add value to this field? I found the answer when
            I was listening to Katie Bouman’s TED Talks video. She talked about
            her challenging responsibility, putting the data from different
            telescopes in a pattern to provide the first image of a black hole
            without being biased to a possible prediction. I got the idea of
            where I needed to be and where I could make the most significant
            impact. There are both theoretical and experimental explorations
            with a united purpose of providing a more in-depth explanation for
            different aspects of the universe. In this regard, I want to put the
            skills I have gained into practice, make more precise predictions to
            provide theories and gather data with a frame from which more
            detailed approximations and projections would be comprehended.
            <br />
            <br />
            I have chosen to have my education centered on computation, with a
            foundation in research and innovation. Therefore, I am actively
            looking forward to find a graduate position which would give me what
            I need to become a professional. After developing my skills further,
            I plan to pursue an academic career in applied physics, and practice
            my passion for the universe.

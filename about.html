              “The discovery of a complete unified theory may not aid the
              survival of our species, and may not even affect our life-style,
              but that humanity's deepest desire for knowledge is justification
              enough for our continuing quest, and that our goal is nothing less
              than a complete description of the Universe we live in.”</em

            I remember when I first heard about M-theory. I wasn’t a Physics
            student. Instead, I was a double-majored student in the engineering
            fields, with great passions in the Physics context. Within my second
            and third years of university, I found myself not fully satisfied
            with learning. I used to enjoy the lectures and investigations.
            However, I used to feel locked to particular thinking ways, not
            being allowed to think creatively when answering questions, which
            seemed rationale for that field, as things had to be in the right
            order to be practical. To feed my curiosity, I had started reading
            Physics context, and the very first book I read was A Brief History
            of Time from Steven Hawking. His words about the unified theory have
            stuck with me ever since then. <br />
            <br />
            Coming from a community of people who think of engineering fields as
            the most promising field of study for a met future life with parents
            who did their best to support their children from every aspect, and
            teachers who contributed to help me with my questions, being
            accepted to Amirkabir University was a significant event. For my
            family and me, this was a way to ensure that I would have the chance
            to leave behind the struggles that they have grown up with.
            Attributing my success to the community of people who have supported
            me, I have been privileged to receive a world-class education in a
            field which, from my point of view, provided me with this
            understanding that human beings are able to think of both abstract
            and concrete subjects that are far away from the daily ones. <br />
            <br />
            When I was about to finish my second year at the university, I
            managed to pursue another degree in Electrical Engineering. Based on
            results from consultations with alumni and my instructors, I thought
            this combination of studies would provide me with a more thorough
            background in Physics. At the same time, I had experienced enjoying
            night walks, coming back from my late-night studies at the
            university’s library, and listening to The Grand Design, The First
            Three Minutes, and similar topics. Through these transformative
            experiences, I realized that where I wanted to continue my studies
            was to provide a better complete description of the universe.
            However, the unanswered question for me was how I can help this
            quest. How can I use my education to add value to this field? I
            found the answer when I was listening to Katie Bouman’s TED Talks
            video. She talked about her challenging responsibility, putting the
            data from different telescopes in a pattern to provide the first
            image of a black hole without being biased to a possible prediction.
            I got the idea of where I needed to be and where I could make the
            most significant impact. There are both theoretical and experimental
            explorations with a united purpose of providing a more in-depth
            explanation for different aspects of the universe. In this regard, I
            want to put the skills I have gained into practice, make more
            precise predictions to provide theories and gather data with a frame
            from which more detailed approximations and projections would be
            comprehended. <br />
            <br />
            I have chosen to have my education centered on computation, with a
            foundation in research and innovation. Therefore, I am actively
            looking forward to find a graduate position which would give me what
            I need to become a professional. After developing my skills further,
            I plan to pursue an academic career in applied physics, and practice
            my passion for the universe.

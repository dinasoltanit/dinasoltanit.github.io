          <!--<h3>What I have been through until now?</h3>-->
          <p>
            In 2016, I started my Aerospace Engineering studies to invest my
            passion for learning new things in the field. As one of the most
            influential majors, my perspective widened with my instructors'
            help, making me more thirsty than before to learn about various
            aspects of science and technology. Becoming interested in
            Aerodynamics with a particular interest in flow control, I felt a
            need to know more about the subject's electromagnetic background.
            With this goal at the top, I started my studies in Electrical
            Engineering, Fields and Waves. That provided me the knowledge that I
            required, giving me a better idea of possible couplings between the
            two majors.

          <p>
            I have chosen to have my education centered on computation, data
            visualization, and data analysis with a foundation in research and
            innovation. Here, I am going to share my attempts to reach this
            goal, gaining what I need to become a professional.

          <h2>My Current Research Areas <br /></h2>
          <h3>Plasma Physics And Its Applications In Aerodynamics</h3>
          <h4>
            Analytical Electrodynamic Modelling Of Dielectric Barrier Discharge
            Plasma Actuators With Considering The Metamaterial Properties Of The
            Plasmonic Region
          </h4>
          <p>
            My purpose is to provide a mathematical model to analytically
            simulate plasma-based flow control actuators based on the
            electrodynamic considerations of the plasmonic medium. The objective
            is to develop the model based on fewer assumptions but more flexible
            for controlling purposes. My ultimate goal is to engineer the
            dielectric to make it tunable to specific modes to control the
            magnitude and the direction of the momentum vector produced by the
            plasma actuator.
          </p>
          <p>
            This current research is for my Electrical Engineering thesis, in
            which I am basically investigating the field of flow control. The
            Aerospace industry is highly investing in active flow control,
            specifically Plasma Actuators, which show promising potentials for
            enhancing aerodynamics characteristics. Although such devices have
            contributed to significant developments, they still have
            limitations. Providing these actuators with the capability to
            control the produced momentum vector’s magnitude and direction
            appears to be a real breakthrough, enabling these actuators to act
            as various elements such as Flap devices or Spoilers, in addition to
            their effective usage in the filed of noise control, mostly
            regarding to the bluff bodies. Being captivated by the discussions
            on flow control, I dealt with several papers whose aim was to change
            the direction of the plasma jet by using magnetic fields to gain
            better-controlling capabilities. Moreover, doing some studies for
            the Electromagnetics course on Metamaterials, I decided to enquire
            whether it would be possible to design materials to provide such
            controlling capabilities for plasma actuators. Doing my research, I
            seek to build up a numerical model using the governing equations of
            both sciences, Navier-Stokes, and Maxwell equations, without typical
            assumptions. Then I would be running a testbench simulation to
            examine the flow behavior under my defined conditions.
          </p>

          <p>
            A considerable step regarding this project was completed when I
            finished my Aerospace Engineering thesis, with the title
            <em
              >Computational Modelling Of Dielectric Barrier Discharge Plasma
              Actuators With Considering The Metamaterial Properties Of The
              Plasma</em
            >. The purpose was to provide a <em>computational model</em> for the
            DBD plasma actuators, including the plasma's metamaterial
            properties. The model solved the governing Poisson's Equation on the
            considered domain, treating the plasmonic region as a dielectric
            media with a calculated permittivity representing the plasmonic
            region under excitation.

          <h3>Shock Pattern visualization</h3>
          <p>
            Our team's purpose is to renew the Aerospace Engineering Departmet's
            Schlieren setup so that we can redo the shock pattern test and
            visualize the generated shocks.

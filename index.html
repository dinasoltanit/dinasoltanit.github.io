          <h2>Greetings, thanks for visiting my website.</h2>
          <p>
            My name is Dina Soltani Tehrani and I am a student double majoring
            in Aerospace Engineering and Electrical Engineering at The Amirkabir
            University of Technology in Tehran, Iran.

            There is one thing I can emphasize about myself … I enjoy getting

          <!--<h3>What I have been through until now?</h3>-->
          <p>
            In 2016, I started my Aerospace Engineering studies to invest my
            passion for learning new things in the field. As one of the most
            influential majors, my perspective widened with my instructors'
            help, making me more thirsty than before to learn about various
            aspects of science and technology. Becoming interested in
            Aerodynamics with a particular interest in flow control, I felt a
            need to know more about the subject's electromagnetic background.
            With this goal at the top, I started my studies in Electrical
            Engineering, Fields and Waves. That provided me the knowledge that I
            required, giving me a better idea of possible couplings between the
            two majors.
          </p>
          <!--<h3>What I'm going to share here on my website?</h3>-->
          <p>
            I have chosen to have my education centered on computation, data
            visualization, and data analysis with a foundation in research and
            innovation. Here, I am going to share my attempts to reach this
            goal, gaining what I need to become a professional.

          <h2>My Current Research Areas <br /></h2>
          <h3>
            Numerical Modeling and Simulation of The Influence of The
            Plasma-based Actuators Fluid Flow Fields
          </h3>
          <h4>
            Electrohydrodynamic Analysis of Dielectric Barrier Discharge
            Actuators Based on The Properties of Low Frequency Plasmons
          </h4>
          <p>
            My purpose is to provide a mathematical model to analytically
            simulate plasma-based flow control actuators based on the properties
            of Low-Frequency Plasmons. The objective is to develop a model based
            on fewer assumptions but more flexible for controlling purposes. My
            ultimate goal is to formulate the influence of the dielectric
            barrier discharge actuators on fluid flow with fewer assumptions but
            more flexiblity to make it tunable in terms of the magnitude and the
            direction of the momentum vector produced by the plasma actuator.
          </p>

          <p>
            The research I did for obtaining the degree of Bachelor of Science
            in Aerospace Engineering and for the degree of Bachelor of Science
            in Electrical Engineering with specialization in Electromagnetics
            was centered on the purpose mentioned above. Working on my Aerospace
            Engineering thesis entitled
            <strong
              >Computational Modelling of Dielectric Barrier Discharge Actuators
              Based on The Properties of Low-Frequency Plasmons</strong
            >, I studied the dominant phenomenological models for the simulation
            of dielectric barrier discharge actuators. I then conceptualized the
            dielectric barrier discharge actuators as a two-layered medium. I
            implemented the properties of low-frequency plasmons based on the
            Lorentz Model to simulate the plasma layer of the actuator's
            structure. Furthermore, I developed a computational model by
            implementing the properties of low-frequency plasmons based on the
            Lorentz Model to incorporate the plasma generation and formulated
            the energy transfer from the plasmonic region to the ambient flow in
            terms of body force components incorporated into the Navier Stokes
            equations as the source terms.
          </p>

          <p>
            Furthermore, with my Electrical Engineering thesis entitled
            <strong
              >Electrodynamic Analysis of Dielectric Barrier Discharge Actuators
              Based on The Properties of Low-Frequency Plasmons</strong
            >, I numerically discretized the integral equation relating the
            electric potential to the charge density on the actuator's
            electrodes for the structure of a dielectric barrier discharge
            actuator, based on the Method of Moments. I determined the
            closed-form spatial Green's Function based on the Complex Images
            Method for electrostatic fields and the Generalized
            pencil-of-function numerical algorithm. I then Implemented Finite
            Difference Approximation to post-process the fields for validation
            purposes. Based on the proposed algorithm, I computed and analyzed
            the electric, electric potential, and electric distance fields for
            varying geometric specs, three different dielectric materials, and
            varying excitation frequencies and applied voltages. The results are
            currently under preparation for being published.
          </p>

          <h3>Shock Pattern visualization</h3>
          <p>
            We visualized the shock wave patterns and the interactions with
            aerodynamic models based on the schlieren photography. The
            experiment was based on the flow interaction with a conical,
            wedge-shaped, and spherical model. Although we got the data for
            preprocessing purposes, our team is about to renew the Aerospace
            Engineering Department's Schlieren setup so that we can redo the
            shock pattern test, validate the results, and analyze the generated
            patterns.
